# Night Notes

[Idea Placeholder] An app to help record those pesky thoughts that pop into your
head in the middle of the night. Can also be used for regular notes, I guess.


## Features

+ Easy to find "Take Note" button.
+ Audio Transcription: Speak your notes and it'll transcribe them.
+ Audio Recording: Your spoken notes are automatically recorded, so you
  can listen to them later (perhaps because the transcription sucks?).
+ Review Reminders: The app will remind you to review any notes you made
  the night before
+ Customizable Note Status: Sometimes those middle-of-the-night ideas are
  crap - you can mark them as such! Or mark them as complete or as something
  to followup with later.
